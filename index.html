<div class="sectionheading">Network</div>

<button class="collapsible">HTTP</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser.
</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">TCP/IP</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol is the standard Internet communications protocols that allow digital computers to communicate over long distances. The Internet is a packet-switched network, in which information is broken down into small packets, sent individually over many different routes at the same time, and then reassembled at the receiving end. TCP is the component that collects and reassembles the packets of data, while IP is responsible for making sure the packets are sent to the right destination. TCP/IP was developed in the 1970s and adopted as the protocol standard for ARPANET (the predecessor to the Internet) in 1983.
</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Unicast</button>
<div class="content">
  <p> Unicast is a one-to-one transmission from one point in the network to another point; that is, one sender and one receiver, each identified by a network address.
</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Broadcast</button>
<div class="content">
  <p> Broadcast is a method of transferring a message to all recipients simultaneously. Broadcasting can be performed as a high-level operation in a program, for example, broadcasting in Message Passing Interface, or it may be a low-level networking operation, for example broadcasting on Ethernet.
</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Multicast</button>
<div class="content">
  <p> Multicast is group communication where data transmission is addressed to a group of destination computers simultaneously. Multicast can be one-to-many or many-to-many distribution. Multicast should not be confused with physical layer point-to-multipoint communication.
</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Anycast</button>
<div class="content">
  <p> Anycast is a network addressing and routing methodology in which a single destination address has multiple routing paths to two or more endpoint destinations. Routers will select the desired path on the basis of number of hops, distance, lowest cost, latency measurements or based on the least congested route. Anycast networks are widely used for content delivery network (CDN) products to bring their content closer to the end user.
</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">SSL</button>
<div class="content">
  <p> SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a secure protocol developed for sending information securely over the Internet. Many websites use SSL for secure areas of their sites, such as user account pages and online checkout. Usually, when you are asked to "log in" on a website, the resulting page is secured by SSL.
</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">VPN</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a public network and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. Applications running across a VPN may therefore benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network. Encryption is a common, although not an inherent, part of a VPN connection.
</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">SDN</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technology is an approach to network management that enables dynamic, programmatically efficient network configuration in order to improve network performance and monitoring, making it more like cloud computing than traditional network management.[1] SDN is meant to address the fact that the static architecture of traditional networks is decentralized and complex while current networks require more flexibility and easy troubleshooting. SDN attempts to centralize network intelligence in one network component by disassociating the forwarding process of network packets (data plane) from the routing process (control plane). The control plane consists of one or more controllers, which are considered the brain of the SDN network where the whole intelligence is incorporated. However, the intelligent centralization has its own drawbacks when it comes to security, scalability and elasticity and this is the main issue of SDN.
</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">OpenFlow</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    OpenFlow is a communications protocol that gives access to the forwarding plane of a network switch or router over the network.
  </p>

  <p>
    OpenFlow enables network controllers to determine the path of network packets across a network of switches. The controllers are distinct from the switches. This separation of the control from the forwarding allows for more sophisticated traffic management than is feasible using access control lists (ACLs) and routing protocols. 
  </p>
    
  <p>
    Also, OpenFlow allows switches from different vendors — often each with their own proprietary interfaces and scripting languages — to be managed remotely using a single, open protocol. The protocol's inventors consider OpenFlow an enabler of software-defined networking (SDN).
  </p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">IPv4</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol (IP). It is one of the core protocols of standards-based internetworking methods in the Internet and other packet-switched networks. IPv4 was the first version deployed for production on SATNET in 1982 and on the ARPANET in January 1983. It still routes most Internet traffic today, despite the ongoing deployment of a successor protocol, IPv6.
</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">IPv6</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is the most recent version of the Internet Protocol (IP), the communications protocol that provides an identification and location system for computers on networks and routes traffic across the Internet. IPv6 was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to deal with the long-anticipated problem of IPv4 address exhaustion. IPv6 is intended to replace IPv4. In December 1998, IPv6 became a Draft Standard for the IETF, who subsequently ratified it as an Internet Standard on 14 July 2017.

</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">REST</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    Representational state transfer (REST) is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating Web services. Web services that conform to the REST architectural style, called RESTful Web services, provide interoperability between computer systems on the internet. RESTful Web services allow the requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of Web resources by using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations. Other kinds of Web services, such as SOAP Web services, expose their own arbitrary sets of operations.
</p>
</div>


<div class="sectionheading">Front-End Development</div>

<button class="collapsible">DOM</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document. The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree; with them one can change the structure, style or content of a document. Nodes can have event handlers attached to them. Once an event is triggered, the event handlers get executed.
</p>

</div>

<button class="collapsible">MVC</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    Model–view–controller is a software design pattern commonly used for developing User interface that divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user.  
  </p>
  <p>
    Model: The central component of the pattern. It is the application's dynamic data structure, independent of the user interface. It directly manages the data, logic and rules of the application.
  </p>
  <p>
    View: Any representation of information such as a chart, diagram or table. Multiple views of the same information are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants.
  </p>
  <p>
    Controller:
    Accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view.
    </p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Sass</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    Sass is a CSS preprocessor, which adds special features such as variables, nested rules and mixins (sometimes referred to as syntactic sugar) into regular CSS. The aim is to make the coding process simpler and more efficient. 
</p>

<p>
  Sass includes two syntax options:

SCSS (Sassy CSS): Uses the .scss file extension and is fully compliant with CSS syntax
Indented (simply called 'Sass'): Uses .sass file extension and indentation rather than brackets; it is not fully compliant with CSS syntax, but it's quicker to write
Note that files can be converted from one syntax to the other using the sass-convert command.

</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Handlebar</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
Handlebars is a simple templating language.

It uses a template and an input object to generate HTML or other text formats. Handlebars templates look like regular text with embedded Handlebars expressions.

A handlebars expression is a {{, some contents, followed by a }}. When the template is executed, these expressions are replaced with values from an input object.
</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Mustache </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Mustache is a web template described as a "logic-less" system because it lacks any explicit control flow statements, like if and else conditionals or for loops; however, both looping and conditional evaluation can be achieved using section tags processing lists and lambdas.
    
    It is named "Mustache" because of heavy use of braces, { }, that resemble a sideways moustache.
    
    Mustache is used mainly for mobile and web applications.</p>
</div>

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Bootstrap</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.

<div class="content">
  <p>
    Angular (commonly referred to as "Angular 2+" or "Angular v2 and above") is a TypeScript-based open-source web application framework led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS.
</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">React</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    React is an open-source, front end, JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with rendering data to the DOM, and so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for state management and routing. Redux and React Router are examples of such libraries.
</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Vue</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    Vue.js is an open-source model–view–viewmodel front end JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.
</p>

<p>
  Vue.js features an incrementally adaptable architecture that focuses on declarative rendering and component composition. The core library is focused on the view layer only. Advanced features required for complex applications such as routing, state management and build tooling are offered via officially maintained supporting libraries and packages, with Nuxt.js as one of the most popular solutions

  Vue.js lets you extend HTML with HTML attributes called directives. The directives offer functionality to HTML applications, and come as either built-in or user defined directives.
</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Svelte</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    Svelte is a free and open-source front end JavaScript framework. Svelte applications do not include framework references. Instead, building a Svelte application generates code to manipulate the DOM, which may reduce the size of transferred files as well as give better client startup and run-time performance. Svelte has its own compiler for converting app code into client-side JavaScript at build time. It is written in TypeScript.The Svelte source code is licensed under MIT License and hosted on GitHub.[9]
</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Meteor</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
   MeteorJS is a free and open-source isomorphic JavaScript web framework written using Node.js. Meteor allows for rapid prototyping and produces cross-platform (Android, iOS, Web) code. It integrates with MongoDB and uses the Distributed Data Protocol and a publish–subscribe pattern to automatically propagate data changes to clients without requiring the developer to write any synchronization code. On the client, Meteor can be used with any popular front-end JS framework, Vue, React, Svelte, or Angular.
</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Ember</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Ember.js is an open-source JavaScript web framework, utilizing a component-service pattern. It allows developers to create scalable single-page web applications[3] by incorporating common idioms, best practices, and patterns from other single-page-app ecosystem patterns into the framework.
  </p>
<p>
    Ember is used on many popular websites, including Apple Music, Square, Groupon, LinkedIn, Nordstrom, Twitch, and Chipotle. Although primarily considered a framework for the web, it is also possible to build desktop and mobile applications in Ember. The most notable example of an Ember desktop application is Apple Music, a feature of the iTunes desktop application.

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Backbone</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Backbone.js is a JavaScript library with a RESTful JSON interface and is based on the model–view–controller application design paradigm. Backbone is known for being lightweight, as its only hard dependency is on one JavaScript library, Underscore.js, plus jQuery for use of the full library. It is designed for developing single-page web applications, and for keeping various parts of web applications (e.g. multiple clients and the server) synchronized. </p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Underscore</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Underscore.js is a JavaScript library which provides utility functions for common programming tasks. It is comparable to features provided by Prototype.js and the Ruby language, but opts for a functional programming design instead of extending object prototypes."</p>

  <p>
    Underscore consists of a little more than 100 functions, which fall under four main categories depending on the datatypes which they manipulate: functions for manipulating arrays, functions for manipulating objects, functions for manipulating both arrays and objects (the name of the category is "Collections") and functions for manipulating other functions. There are also two utility categories: "Utility" and "Chaining".
  </p>

  </p>

  <p>Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. The framework emphasizes reusability and "pluggability" of components, less code, low coupling, rapid development, and the principle of don't repeat yourself. Python is used throughout, even for settings, files, and data models. Django also provides an optional administrative create, read, update and delete interface that is generated dynamically through introspection and configured via admin models.
  </p>

  <p>Some well known sites that use Django include PBS, Instagram, Mozilla, The Washington Times, and Nextdoor. </p>

</div>

<button class="collapsible">Flask</button>
<div class="content">
  <p> Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools.</p>

  <p>Applications that use the Flask framework include Pinterest and LinkedIn.</p>
